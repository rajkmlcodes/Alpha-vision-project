# Repository Name: AlphaVision-Web

## Description:

Welcome to the AlphaVision project repository! Developed during my web development internship at InternPe, AlphaVision is a comprehensive platform designed to empower agencies to seamlessly deliver their services both online and offline. This project, crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focuses on providing a user-friendly interface for agencies to showcase their offerings effectively.

In the development process, I utilized popular design tools such as Figma and Eraser.io to create a visually appealing and intuitive UI. Additionally, for editing images and creating graphics, tools like Canva and Photoshop were instrumental in refining the aesthetic elements of the website.

It's important to note that AlphaVision currently encompasses only the frontend aspect, lacking any backend integration. However, its modular architecture and well-structured codebase lay a solid foundation for future expansion and backend integration.

Feel free to explore the AlphaVision repository, contribute to its development, and leverage it as a learning resource for web development projects. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated as we strive to enhance the functionality and usability of AlphaVision. Let's shape the future of online agency services together!
